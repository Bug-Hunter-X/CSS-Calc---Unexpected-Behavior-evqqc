The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly.  For example, attempting to use `calc()` with percentages and other units without proper ordering or parenthesis can lead to incorrect calculations. Another less common issue is when using `calc()` with variables that haven't been defined or are undefined, resulting in unexpected layout or rendering.
